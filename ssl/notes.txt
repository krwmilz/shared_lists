 Server
========

Our certificates in this directory are provided by let's encrypt.
I think they will expire in 2016-03.

To get a certificate that IO::Socket::SSL will like, you have to concatenate
cert.pem and chain.pem to produce cert_chain.pem.


 APN
=====

apn/ directory has all apple push notification certificates and keys.

- apn/aps.key: 2048 bit rsa private key
- apn/aps.csr: certificate signing request, created from aps.key
- apn/aps.cer: DER encoded certificate from Apple, created from aps.csr
- apn/aps.pem: conversion of aps.cer to PEM format for use in program
