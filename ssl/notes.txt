Our certificates in ssl/ are provided by let's encrypt.
I think they will expire in 2016-03.

To get a certificate that IO::Socket::SSL will like, you have to concatenate
cert.pem and chain.pem to produce cert_chain.pem.

Also, concatenating cert.pem and fullchain.pem works, but fullchain.pem has a
larger file size. I'm unsure at this point which one is (more) correct, as they
both work.
